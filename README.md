**Project Overview**
This GitHub repository contains the source code and documentation for our course recommendation system developed by our team. The system is designed to help students find suitable courses based on their interests and study levels. It employs a collaborative filtering approach, to make personalized course recommendations.


**Features**
Input Preferences: The system prompts students to input their preferences, including interests and study levels.

Course Matching: The system identifies the most similar courses to the student's preferences by using KNN collaborative filtering. It constructs a candidate course set based on course similarities.

Interest Prediction: The system calculates the average interest value of the candidate student set and uses it as the predicted value of the interest for the target student.
